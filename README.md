# AngularMaterialCustomTheme

Welcome to Code With Srini, in this lecture I am gonna talk about theming Angular Material Design application.
Material Design by default provides you with a set of pre-built themes such as;

deeppurple-amber.css
indigo-pink.css
pink-bluegrey.css
purple-green.css

Basically, indigo is the primary color and pink will be a accent color.
Theming in material design is done by composing multiple colours by following colour guide from Material Design Spec.
